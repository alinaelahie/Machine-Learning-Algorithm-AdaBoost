AdaBoost: An Adaptive Boosting Approach

Group: Alina Elahie, Daniel Esguerra, Rihana Mohamed

Project Overview:
This project explores Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), an ensemble machine learning algorithm that sequentially improves weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. The report provides an in-depth analysis of AdaBoost's mechanics, real-world applications, performance considerations, and its implementation using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. Additionally, we provide a brief comparison to Random Forest to highlight key differences in performance.

AdaBoost is a widely used boosting algorithm in machine learning due to its ability to improve the performance of weak classifiers. Unlike Random Forest, which builds multiple decision trees in parallel, AdaBoost works sequentially by assigning higher weights to misclassified instances, improving its accuracy and making it effective in handling complex classification problems.

AdaBoost Mechanism:
Initialize Weights: Starts by assigning equal weights to all training samples
Train Weak Learner: Fits a simple model (e.g. decision stump) on the weighted dataset
Evaluate Errors: Measures learner performance and calculates the weighted error rate
Update Weights: Increase weights of misclassified samples to make them more important
Compute Learner Weight: Assigns more influence to more accurate learners with a confidence score
Combine Learners: Final prediction is a weighted vote of all weak learners
Real-World Applications
Medical Imaging & Diagnosis: Enhances diagnostic accuracy for diseases like cancer and heart disease.
Face Detection: Used in computer vision applications to detect faces in images and videos.
Fraud Detection: Identifies fraudulent transactions in financial systems.
Spam Detection: Classifies emails as spam or not spam
Strengths and Limitations:
Strengths	Limitations
Adaptive Learning: AdaBoost gives more weight to mistakes, allowing it to focus on difficult cases.	Sensitive to Noise: Misclassified data gets higher weight, leading to overemphasis on noisy samples.
Resists Overfitting: Weighted voting prevents any single tree from dominating the prediction.	Sequential Processing: Must train trees one by one, making it slower than Random Forest.
Feature Selection: Automatically identifies the most important features.	Learning Rate Sensitivity: A high learning rate can cause overfitting, while a low rate may require more iterations.
Improves weak classifiers iteratively	Sensitive to noisy data and outliers
Reduces bias and variance effectively	Computationally expensive with large datasets
Often achieves high accuracy	Requires careful parameter tuning
AdaBoost vs. Random Forest:
Feature	AdaBoost	Random Forest
Tree Training	Sequential (Boosting)	Parallel (Bagging)
Bootstrap Sampling	No (Uses all data with changing weights)	Yes (Each tree gets a bootstrap sample)
OOB Score Available	No	Yes
Learning Rate	Crucial parameter	Not applicable
Tree Depth	Typically shallow (decision stumps)	Deeper trees
Parallel Processing	Not efficient (sequential nature)	Highly parallelizable
